# Quantum Gaussian Dynamics

This package performs the quantum nuclear dynamics of a system under impulsive radiation (Pump-Probe).
It works by integrating the Time-Dependent Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation equations of motion.

# Install on a new machine
julia; using Pkg; 
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(path="path/QuantumGaussianDynamics.jl"))

# Activate and add dependencies
open Julia shell
enter the package mode (type ])
activate the packacge (activate . )
add the dependency (add LinearAlgebra)

# Also install cellconstructor and Python-sscha
pip install Cellconstructor;
pip install python-sscha

# Fixes
#
# Sometimes the default python used by PyCall is different with respect to the main one on which all the packages are installed
# This can be checked with
julia; using PyCall; PyCall.python
# if the output is different to 
which python
# then the pkg PyCall should be rebuild as
ENV["PYTHON"] = "[path to the right python]"
import Pkg
Pkg.build("PyCall")
   
# install SSCHA
#
#NB! julia has been removed from the command, and python has been downgraded to 3.10:
conda create -n sscha -c conda-forge python=3.10 gfortran libblas lapack openmpi openmpi-mpicc pip numpy scipy spglib=2.2 setuptools=64
conda activate sscha
# again julia has been removed:
pip install ase mpi4py
pip install cellconstructor python-sscha tdscha
